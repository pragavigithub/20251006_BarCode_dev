# Fix Checklist - Your Local Environment Only

## ✅ What's Working (Don't Touch)

Based on your logs:
- ✅ Barcode column size is FIXED (no "data too long" errors)
- ✅ Items are being added successfully (302 redirects)
- ✅ Barcode generation is working
- ✅ All GRPO functionality works EXCEPT detail page

## ❌ What's Broken (One Line Fix)

- ❌ Template not found error when viewing GRPO detail page

## 🎯 The Single Fix Needed

### Your Local File:
```
E:\emerald\20251022\11\20251006_BarCode_dev\modules\grpo\routes.py
```

### Line 17 - Current (WRONG):
```python
grpo_bp = Blueprint('grpo', __name__, url_prefix='/grpo')
```

### Line 17 - Should Be (CORRECT):
```python
grpo_bp = Blueprint('grpo', __name__, url_prefix='/grpo', template_folder='templates')
```

### What to Add:
Add this text before the closing `)`:
```
, template_folder='templates'
```

## 📋 Quick Steps

1. Open `E:\emerald\20251022\11\20251006_BarCode_dev\modules\grpo\routes.py`
2. Go to line 17
3. Add `, template_folder='templates'` at the end (before the `)`)
4. Save file
5. Restart Flask (Ctrl+C, then `python main.py`)
6. Test - Detail page will work! ✅

## ✅ After This Fix

Everything will work perfectly:
- ✅ Add items to GRPO
- ✅ Generate barcodes
- ✅ View detail pages (currently broken, will be fixed)
- ✅ Edit items
- ✅ Serial/batch management

## 🔍 Why Only This One Line?

The Replit environment already has this fix (line 17 is correct here).
Your local environment is missing this one parameter.
That's literally the only difference causing the error.
