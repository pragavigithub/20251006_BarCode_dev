Summary Workflow

User opens Multiple GRN Creation module.

User selects a Customer (from Business Partners API).

System loads all Open POs for that customer.

User selects multiple POs.

System fetches open line items for each selected PO.

User confirms creation → system posts GRNs via PurchaseDeliveryNotes API.

Response and status saved to database.
