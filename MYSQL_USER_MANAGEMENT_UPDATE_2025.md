# MySQL/PostgreSQL User Management Update - October 2025

## Summary
User Management module improvements implemented on October 9, 2025. **No database schema changes required.**

## Changes Made

### 1. Bug Fixes
- **Fixed User Deactivation Issue**: Corrected template bug where `user.is_active` was used instead of `user.active`
  - The database schema was already correct with `active` field
  - Templates were using the wrong field name causing deactivation to appear broken
  - Fixed in: `templates/user_management.html`, `templates/edit_user.html` (Oct 9, 2025)

### 2. Security Improvements
- **Removed Delete User Functionality**: Users can now only be deactivated, not permanently deleted
  - Preserves user history and audit trail
  - Prevents accidental data loss
  - Disabled route: `/delete_user/<user_id>` (commented out in routes.py)
  - Removed delete buttons from UI

### 3. New Features
- **User Profile Module**: Added self-service profile management for all users
  - New route: `/profile` - View own profile
  - New route: `/profile/edit` - Edit own profile (name, email, password)
  - New templates: `user_profile.html`, `edit_profile.html`
  - Updated navigation: Added "My Profile" link in user dropdown menu

### 4. Access Control Updates
- **Admin Privileges**: Full access to user management (unchanged)
- **Regular Users**: Can only view and edit their own profile
- **Role-based Access**: Preserved existing permission system

## Database Schema Status

### No Changes Required
The User model schema remains unchanged:
```python
class User(UserMixin, db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(256), nullable=False)
    first_name = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=True)
    last_name = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=True)
    role = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False, default='user')
    branch_id = db.Column(db.String(10), nullable=True)
    branch_name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=True)
    default_branch_id = db.Column(db.String(10), nullable=True)
    is_active = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=True)  # <-- This field was already correct
    must_change_password = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
    last_login = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
    permissions = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
```

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Installations (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
**NO MIGRATION REQUIRED** - This is a code-only update.

1. Pull the latest code changes
2. Restart the application
3. Verify:
   - User deactivation now works correctly
   - Delete user buttons are removed
   - Profile link appears in user dropdown menu
   - Users can view and edit their profiles

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Delete user buttons are removed from UI
- [ ] Profile link appears in navigation for all users
- [ ] Users can view their own profile
- [ ] Users can edit their own profile (name, email)
- [ ] Users can change their password from profile

## Files Modified

### Templates
- `templates/user_management.html` - Fixed active/is_active bug, removed delete buttons
- `templates/edit_user.html` - Fixed active/is_active bug (Oct 9, 2025)
- `templates/base.html` - Added profile links to navigation
- `templates/user_profile.html` - NEW: User profile view
- `templates/edit_profile.html` - NEW: User profile edit

### Routes
- `routes.py` - Added profile routes, disabled delete_user route

### Database

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, revert the changes by:
1. `git revert <commit-hash>` to restore previous version
2. Restart application
3. No database rollback needed as no schema changes were made

## Notes for Developers

- The `active` field in the User model is the correct field to check user status
- Always use `user.active` in templates, not `user.is_active`
- User deletion is permanently disabled - use deactivation instead
- Users can now manage their own profiles without admin intervention
